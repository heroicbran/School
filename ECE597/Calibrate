For Calibration:

Need Screen for interaction?

Make a second thread that listens for a certain input?
Hide other outputs momentary couts for a moment. Have a calibrate_on var??

After that, the screen prompts you to make positions for 10 seconds each.

Just don't take data immediately. Act like PC grub?

-------------------

After, GPS location, EKG monitor, and update appearance of data aquisition. (Perhaps a maanual adjuster for Thresholds?)
