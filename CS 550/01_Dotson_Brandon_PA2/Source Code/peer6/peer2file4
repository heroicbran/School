And of Clay Are We Created
by Isabel Allende, translated by Margaret Sayers Peden
BACKGROUND
This selection by is fictional, but it is based on a real event. In 
1985, a volcano erupted in Colombia. The heat of the volcano 
melted sheets of ice, resulting in mudslides. More than 23,000 
people were killed. The media focused much attention on a 
thirteen-year-old girl trapped in the mud. In this story, the girl 
is called Azucena, and her rescuer is named Rolf Carlé.
They discovered the girl’s head protruding from the mudpit, 
eyes wide open, calling soundlessly. She had a First Communion 
name, Azucena.

 Lily. In that vast cemetery where the odor of 
death was already attracting vultures from far away, and where 
the weeping of orphans and wails of the injured filled the air, the 
little girl obstinately clinging to life became the symbol of the 
tragedy. The television cameras transmitted so often the 
unbearable image of the head budding like a black squash from 
the clay that there was no one who did not recognize her and 
know her name. And every time we saw her on the screen, right 
behind her was Rolf Carlé,

 who had gone there on assignment, 
never suspecting that he would find a fragment of his past, lost 
thirty years before.

of the eruption could detach the eternal ice from the slopes of 
the volcano, but no one heeded their warnings; they sounded like 
the tales of frightened old women. The towns in the valley went 
about their daily life, deaf to the moaning of the earth, until that 
fateful Wednesday night in November when a prolonged roar 
announced the end of the world, and walls of snow broke loose, 
rolling in an avalanche of clay, stones, and water that descended 
on the villages and buried them beneath unfathomable meters 
of telluric

 vomit.

 As soon as the survivors emerged from the 
paralysis of that first awful terror, they could see that houses, 
plazas, churches, white cotton plantations, dark coffee forests, 
cattle pastures—all had disappeared. Much later, after soldiers 
and volunteers had arrived to rescue the living and try to assess 
the magnitude of the cataclysm,
6
 it was calculated that beneath 
the mud lay more than twenty thousand human beings and 
an indefinite number of animals putrefying in a viscous soup.
7
Forests and rivers had also been swept away, and there was 
nothing to be seen but an immense desert of mire.

When the station called before dawn, Rolf Carlé and 
I were together. I crawled out of bed, dazed with sleep, and 
went to prepare coffee while he hurriedly dressed. He stuffed 
his gear in the green canvas backpack he always carried, and 
we said goodbye, as we had so many times before. I had no 
presentiments. I sat in the kitchen, sipping my coffee and
