PA2 To DO:

X) Bind clients to multiple servers w/ if (Servers use ports starting with 2000) 

X) Mod GetID?)

X) Make random file record peer info

X) Search goes through each of the servers w/ for loop

X) Threads still interact with each other the same as before (peer use ports with 9000).

--- MAKE SURE THIS^ WORKS FIRST!

4) Testing. Make the server(s) wait for all clients to connect, then have them all use their search together.

5. Fix client/server closing issues



//////////////////////////
Issue: Main is bloated because of issues with functions and rpc s/c

Get_ID still centralized
